Today, in various fields of engineering, including structural and earthquake, much research is done concerning artificial intelligence and
optimization.Structural analysis is required in the programming process in most of such studies. Researchers use different methods to solve
this problem, one of the most effective of which is linking MATLAB software with powerful structural analysis software. SAP2000 software,
founded in 1975 by CSI affiliated with Berkeley University, is one of the most powerful software. The software of CSI has been used by 
thousands of engineering firms in over 160 countries for the design of major projects, including the Taipei 101 Tower in Taiwan,
One World Trade Center in New York, the 2008 Olympics Birds Nest Stadium in Beijing, and the cable-stayed Centenario Bridge over 
the Panama Canal. CSI’s software is backed by more than four decades of research and development, making it the trusted choice of
sophisticated design professionals everywhere.

The company offers CSI OAPI to link its products to programming languages based on the Visual Basic programming language and provides
an example for other programming languages. In relation to MATLAB software, indirect commands are used for modeling, and string variables
and vectors follow the Visual Basic commands, which creates problems for MATLAB‌ programmers. In the SM toolbox, CSI OAPI commands are
provided as explicit MATLAB functions, making it much easier for MATLAB programmers to use. The toolbox is also designed to support 
SAP2000 and CSi BRiDGE software from version 17 to the latest.
